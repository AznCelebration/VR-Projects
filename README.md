# My various VR applications created for university projects

Project 1: A VR game where you are surrounded by a brick wall and must use cannonballs to shoot your way out. (Oculus Rift)

Project 2: An application consisting of a 3D environment of UCSD's VR Lab. The Oculus Rift Touch controllers allow you to interact with
           the objects in the room and design the lab as you see fit. (Oculus Rift and Touch)

Project 3: A VR game where you fly through the sky in order to reach checkpoints and achieve the fastest time possible. (Oculus Rift and Leap)

Final Project: An implementation of the game Pacman but in a 3D environment and with VR capabilities where you share Pacman's POV as you
               run through the maze. (Oculus Rift and Touch)
